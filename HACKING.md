Summary
-------

- Do not edit the CSS directly, edit the source SCSS files and run `./parse-sass.sh`

- To be able to use the latest/adequate version of sass, install `sassc`

How to tweak the theme
----------------------

Like the upstream Adwaita, this theme is written and processed in Sass.

You can read about Sass at http://sass-lang.com/documentation/. Once you make
your changes to the SCSS files, run the `./parse-sass.sh` script to rebuild the
CSS files.

Here's a rundown of the _supporting_ stylesheets:

- `_variables.scss`

  variables to allow easier definition of widget sizing/styling.

It is very likely your change will happen in the `_common.scss` file. That's where
all the widget selectors are defined. Here's a rundown of the "supporting"
stylesheets, that are unlikely to be the right place for a drive by stylesheet
fix:

- `_colors.scss`

  global color definitions. We keep the number of defined colors to a necessary
  minimum, most colors are derived form a handful of basics. It covers both the
  light variant and the dark variant.

- `_colors-public.scss`

  SCSS colors exported through gtk to allow for 3rd party apps color mixing.

- `_drawing.scss`

  drawing helper mixings/functions to allow easier definition of widget drawing
  under specific context. This is why Flat-Plat isn't 15000 LOC.

- `_common.scss`

  actual definitions of style for each widget. This is where you are likely to
  add/remove your changes.

- `_apps.scss` or `_extensions.scss`

  app/extension specific stylings.

How to change the assets color
------------------------------

To keep it maintainable SVG files are basically edited on text-based.

So if you just want to change the SVG assets color, we recommend using a
**text editor** instead of **Inkscape**. However, please note that Inkscape is
required to render the PNG assets from the SVG files.

Here is an example to change the _accent color_:

1. Open the following `.svg` files with a **text editor**.

  - ./src/gtk-2.0/assets.svg
  - ./src/gtk-2.0/assets-dark.svg
  - ./src/gtk-3.0/gtk-common/assets.svg
  - ./src/gnome-shell/3.18/assets/checkbox.svg
  - ./src/gnome-shell/3.18/assets/more-results.svg
  - ./src/gnome-shell/3.18/assets/toggle-on.svg
  - ./src/gnome-shell/3.18/assets-dark/checkbox.svg
  - ./src/gnome-shell/3.18/assets-dark/more-results.svg
  - ./src/gnome-shell/3.18/assets-dark/toggle-on.svg

2. Search `#FF4081` (default accent color) and replace with your favorite color.

  - The recommended color palette is: https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-palette

3. For gtk2 and gtk3, delete all png assets before redrawing them.

  ```sh
  rm -v ./src/gtk-2.0/assets/*.png
  rm -v ./src/gtk-2.0/assets-dark/*.png
  rm -v ./src/gtk-3.0/gtk-common/assets/*.png
  ```

4. Run `./render-assets.sh` or `./render-assets-dark.sh` to render the PNG assets.

  > Note: Inkscape must be installed to run the scripts.

  - for gtk2:

    ```sh
    cd ./src/gtk-2.0
    ./render-assets.sh
    ./render-assets-dark.sh
    ```

  - for gtk3:

    ```sh
    cd ./src/gtk-3.0/gtk-common
    ./render-assets.sh
    ```
